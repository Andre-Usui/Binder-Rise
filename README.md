# BINDER RISE
  - Welcome to the Binder Rise! 
      This app was developed to solve one of my main problems during my studies and content production: Separating, organizing and finding data in a structured and agile way. 

      I am a student who uses writing to reinforce my learning.  However, when I found myself with 3 notebooks full of content, I saw the chaos of finding specific data to apply in my daily life. 

      So I created Binder Rise and i hope that this also help you to study and achieve your goals.

      In this App you can separate your content by Disciplines, Pages and Posts. In each post you can title, save the content, references with links. Everything customizable, editable and relocatable. 

      The App does not use logins or passwords as it stores your data in your Local Storage. You can Download or upload your Binder to use on any device. 

  - Binder Rise uses: 
    - React;
    - idb (indexedDB);
    - react-beatiful-dnd (drag n' drop);
    - gh-pages.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

# Why should i use Binder Rise

  - You are studying something? You know that you have to write everything you can to help you memorize any content, huh?.
  - I've always have a notebook on my side because of this. At first, that was suficient for me. Now that i have 3 notebooks, completely unorganized, with various contents of variable references. I thought that i've need a new notebook just to organize and have a better way to search my notings. 

  - Then i create this app. Here you can add your contents, edit then, organize, reorganize, delete anything, and style it as you want. You can create more and more disciplines
