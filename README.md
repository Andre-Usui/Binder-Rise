# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

# Why should i use Binder Rise

  - You are studying something? You know that you have to write everything you can to help you memorize any content, huh?.
  - I've always have a notebook on my side because of this. At first, that was suficient for me. Now that i have 3 notebooks,
  - completely unorganized, with varius contents of variable references. I thought that i've need a new notebook just to 
  - organize and have a better way to search my notings. 

  - Then i create this app. Here you can add your contents, edit then, organize, reorganize, delete anything, and style it as 
  - you want. You can create more and more disciplines
